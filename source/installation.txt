------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

As the Delphi version of Quake2 engine alters your cfg files
(just as original Quake2 does as well), we suggest that you
make a copy of your Quake2 directory before proceeding!

Requiremements:

Quake2 original version updated to 3.20 OR
Quake2 3.14 demo version.

Delphi6 (personal will do) for building the Delphi port from source code.

FreePascal 2.0.2 for building FPC port from source code

Sourcecode:

Sourcecode is structured just as the original C-language 
code was. Additionally there is couple directories:

directx\ (contains DirectSound support headers)
Projects\ (contains Delphi project files)
Projects\build\ (compiled executables will go here)
Projects\build\unit\ (temporary compilation files end up here)

When you choose build from Delphi, it will build the
executables to "build" directory under "Projects"
directory. You need to then copy then "quake2d.exe"
to your Quake2 installation directory to play with
Delphi version. 

NOTE: If you will compile other projects (ref_soft.dll,
gamex86.dll, ...), they use same filenames than originals.
Remember to make backup copies of original files!

NOTE: If you are going to debug or modify any of the
modules, you most likely want to compile modules directly
over originals (MAKE BACKUPS!), you need to setup additional
command line parameters when running any of the dlls
in delphi:

Host Application: point it to quake2d.exe you have just compiled.
Command Line Parameters: 
+set basedir c:\games\quake2\ +set gamedir c:\games\quake2\baseq2\

You need to ofcourse replace paths to the place where quake2 is
installed in your computer.
